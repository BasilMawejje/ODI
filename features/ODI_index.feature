Feature: The welcome page
  As a User
  in order to make a donation
  I need to visit a landing page

  Scenario: User visits the site
    Given I navigate to the index page
    Then I should see "ODI is aimed at raising domestic resources through an ENDOWMENT FUND to support treatment and stop the flow of new infections."
